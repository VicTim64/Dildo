              NeoTech's primary objective is to offer 3D Mapping As a Service 
              to the entire Web3 ecosystem by securely listing and managing 
              our data on the blockchain.
            </p>
            <p className="fn_desc fn_animated_text">
              Our assets are exclusive to our virtual ecosystem, 
              ensuring they remain secured and protected. 
              Data is stored on SSD DePin nodes and hashed to ZKP ERC20 rollups and our dedicated servers, accessible only to verified data owners.
            </p>
            <p className="fn_desc fn_animated_text">
              Users can mint, trade, rent, or subscribe to assets on our marketplace 
              by connecting their decentralized wallets, ensuring complete privacy with 
              no personal information stored. Renters benefit from asset usage within the ecosystem, 
              while subscribers can access unowned assets for a limited time, providing flexibility and maximizing asset utility.
